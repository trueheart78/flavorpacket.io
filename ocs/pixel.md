<p class="m-4">
<b>Pixel</b> is a 23 year old caricature artist at the carnival, and enjoys making others smile. She has green hair, glasses, sometimes wears a hat, and always has her brush.
</p>

<p class="m-4">
<b>Backstory</b><br>
Pixel was three years old when her ability to use drawing-based magic manifested. When her moms Aster and Daisy saw this, they reached out to a local artist and friend of the family, the renowned Roshambo. Under their tutelage, Pixel came into her own. She learned how to focus her brush, and how to affect the real-world with her art.
</p>

<p class="m-4">
When she was 19, her coastal hometown of Sweetport dealt with massive flooding, and Pixel's magic was useless to stop it. However, her longtime friend (and one of Roshambo's other students), Voxel, was able to put a stop to the flooding. They became the town's saviour and hero, while Pixel felt like a complete failure.
</p>

<p class="m-4">
Feeling down, she sought comfort at the carnival that had come into town. Dazzled and delighted by the performances and the performers, she soon found herself at the ringmaster's tent, convincing them to let her join. And so, when the carnival left town a few days later, Pixel vanished along with it.
