<b>Blurb</b><br>
A monk that loves to hit things. Her fists come in very handy, and she recently acquired a metal quarterstaff, which is causing her enemies a lot of consternation. A menace in disguise, she really doesn't take any shit.

<b>Backstory</b><br>
A stranger in the human body she inhabits, she took it over from its owner when escaping her dying realm. 
</p><p class="m-4">
The original owner’s name was Jade, hence why her first jacket had the name “Jade” written on it.
