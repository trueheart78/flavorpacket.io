<b>Backstory</b><br>
Guardian and guide to the young Garaile Haizea-la, she was appointed by the late Emperor's parents for her political neutrality, and to help him understand life from an outsider’s perspective.
</p><p class="m-4">
She was raised in Inbal-ya, growing up with her family, near the forest. Her parents had three children, and she was brought up alongside her older brother and younger sister. All were taught how to defend themselves, however, she is the only one who felt the calling of the blade. The dance it brought out in her (and her desire to master it), led her to join the local military, in hopes of being able to put it to good use.
</p><p class="m-4">
After years of plying herself, her sword, and her mind, her officer and mentor came to her with some quite surprising news: the Emperor was requesting her to become a guardian and guide to the young Garaile.
