<p class="m-4">
<b>Li Wei</b> is a master swordsman and stout defender of the mandate of heaven.</p>

<p class="m-4">
<b>Backstory</b><br>
Guardian and guide to the young Emperor Garaile Haizea-la, she was appointed by the late Emperor's parents for her political neutrality, and to help him understand life from an outsider’s perspective.
</p><p class="m-4">
She was raised in Inbal-ya, growing up with her family, near the forest. Her parents had three children, and she was brought up alongside her older brother and younger sister. All were taught how to defend themselves, however, she is the only one who felt the calling of the blade. The dance it brought out in her (and her desire to master it), led her to join the local military, in hopes of being able to put it to good use.
</p><p class="m-4">
After years of plying herself, her sword, and her mind, her officer and mentor came to her with some quite surprising news: the Emperor was requesting her to become a guardian and guide to the young Garaile.
</p>
<p class="m-4">
<b>What motivates them?</b><br>
She is fighting to preserve the Mandate of Heaven from internal rot.
</p><p class="m-4">
<b>What are they afraid of?</b><br>
Potentially having to destroy Emperor Garaile if he becomes a threat to the kingdom. Secondarily, failing him when he has given her his utmost trust.
</p>

<p class="m-4">
<b>What do they love most?</b><br>
Food. From exotic to common, they adore it. Meals that are considered suspect are often some of her favorites. She truly appreciates it all, and rarely speaks ill of any food, even if it makes her sick.
</p>

<p class="m-4">
<b>What do they do for fun?</b><br>
Xiangqi. She has been playing it for as long as she can remember, and was taught by her father. She loves fencing and swordplay, as well. She still uses the scabbard her parents gave her when she joined the militia ages ago. She also loves reading.
</p>

<p class="m-4">
<b>Any pet peeves?</b><br>
People who speak in riddles to sound profound. Also, those who feel the need to loudly and dramatically clear their throats before speaking to the Emperor.
</p>
